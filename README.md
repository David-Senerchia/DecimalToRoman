# DecimalToRoman

Created by David Senerchia. A program to provide a flexible and inflexible solution to the problem of converting decimal numbers to Roman numerals. In the flexible solution, a user can eliminate size limits to a number, create Roman numeral representations of negative numbers, and define their own letters to be used for Roman numerals.
